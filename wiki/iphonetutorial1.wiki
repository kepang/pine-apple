*Tutorial #1:* Opening application for the first time and registering an account
Billy has just bought iClicky from the application store as directed by his CMPT 275 instructor. He opens the application for the first time planning on registering his account with the phone before class.  Here are the steps Billy followed:
 
 # Find the iClicky icon on the Springboard and open it.
 # A form should open up which looks similar to this:
 

 # Enter information into the text boxes while making sure the information entered matches what is listed with the school.
 # Click SUBMIT when finished.
