== 1. Project Overview ==

 # *Summary*
  * Our goal is to create a game, called the iFit, which has various mini-games which are used to calculate an overall “fitness” level. The overall result is tracked and posted online allowing the user to view their progress for each individual mini-game and their overall “fitness” level on any iPhone/ iTouch (this also implies multiple people can create multiple accounts on a single iPhone / iTouch).
 # *Stakeholders*
  * Herbert Tsang
   * Listed as the administer for the application therefore if the application fails it ruins his reputation among the Apple community
  * Team Pine-Apple 
   * The developers of the application who receive majority (if not all) of the responsibility of the failure/ success of the application
   * The grades of Team Pine-Apple are also on the line
  * Apple Inc.
   * As the creator of the iPhone and iTouch if they place the iFit on their app store and the application is severely disliked by the users their reputation is lowered throughout the technological world
  * The “health” of iPhone/ iTouch owners
   * As it will be iPhone/ iTouch users “health that will be the problem that the iFit will be trying to fix, if the users fail to increase their overall score over a given period of time the application could possibly be considered as a failure
 # *Users*
  * iPhone/ iTouch gamers
  * Fitness enthusiasts 
 # *Assumptions*
  * The word gamer means someone who plays a multitude of games, new and old, on a given medium (in this case the iPhone/ iTouch)
  * People want to become fit
  * Ability to read English

=== Risk Management ===


||Risk ||Probability ||Impact||Action Plan ||Contingency Plan||

||Difficulty of project is underestimated||Medium ||High||Investigate difficulty of core features early on in the process to minimize surprises.||Every member will have to work overtime in order to bring the project to completion.||

||Team member dies / gets sick||Low ||High||None||Re-allocate work to other members||

||Team member drops course||Low ||High||Ask team members to provide warning if they plan to drop the course.||Make sure that the work that team member is working on is sent to other working members.||

||The time required to develop software is underestimated ||Medium ||Moderate||Identify core features which must be completed.  Additional features can be added or dropped accordingly.||Every member will have to work overtime in order to bring the project to completion.||

||Modification to the design of our project ||Medium ||Moderate||Freeze requirements before implementation phase.||Create a group meeting and discuss about modifications that will cause less change.||

||Team member fails to complete assigned task ||Low ||Moderate||The project manager will check on team members to see if they are on schedule.||Assign the work to another team member.||

||Computer Malfunction ||Low ||Moderate||Check for health of team members' computers.  Resolve any issues that could be problems later.   Each team member is responsible for backing up their own work to external location (eg. Email)||Use school computers to continue work or pass backup files to another team member.||

||Team member fails to attend meeting ||Low ||Low||Schedule meetings at a time when everyone is available.||Tell the team member what the meeting will be about and input some quick thoughts. Email the minutes of the meeting to the member.||

||Google code fails, Google server fails ||Low ||Low||Back up web contents regularly.  Find a back up web host.||Put everything on the back up host. Email the link to the professor.||
