== 1.0 Introduction ==

iClicky is an application designed for iPhone/ iTouch mobile devices. It is designed to be used in classrooms as a way to quiz students during lectures as well as being able to take attendance. iClicky will have 5 multiple choice buttons that will be used to select an answer to a question displayed by the application. It will also have the ability to register a student account to the device so the instructor has the ability to view each studentâ€™s mark. This is also to prevent students from being able to change accounts in the middle of a quiz (this would most likely be done by someone who plans to write quizzes for multiple students).  The results are recorded onto an online database where the instructor has the ability to view students marks, add students to specific classes, and create passwords for each lecture to ensure only those who attend lecture will be able to do the quiz.
